## Prerequisites

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) must be installed.

## Installation

* Running `yarn` in the app's root directory will install everything you need for development.

## Development Server

* `yarn start` will run the app's development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with hot module reloading.

## Running Tests

* `yarn test` will run the tests once.
* `yarn test:watch` will run the tests on every change.

## Building

* `yarn build` creates a production build by default.

   To create a development build, set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `development` while running this command.

* `yarn clean` will delete built resources.
